Sidestreams and the tidywater package were made possible by the wonderful open-source tools created by the R community. We want to give credit where it's due and continue to foster collaboration and innovation.

## Tidywater

The tidywater package depends on functions from existing R packages, including:

-   dplyr

-   tidyr

-   knitr

-   ggplot2

-   ggrepel

-   magrittr

-   purrr

-   furrr

-   methods

-   rlang

## Sidestreams

This blog is built in Quarto and is deployed using GitHub pages. See our public repository <a href = "https://github.com/libbymckenna/sidestreams"> here</a>. In addition to the packages listed above, the `tidyverse` package is used throughout the blog.
